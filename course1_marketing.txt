  - *Python concept: File path manipulation (os.path module)*

## Phase 5: Rich Features & Quality (Weeks 9-12)

**Weeks 9-10: OOP Model & Visualization**
- **Object Model**: Users work with intuitive objects like accounts and transactions.
  - *Python concept: Class definition, constructors (__init__)*
- **Data Visualization**: Spending patterns appear as charts and graphs.
  - *Python concept: matplotlib library, object-oriented API*
- **Visual Reports**: Budget status is presented with colorful visualizations.
  - *Python concept: Method encapsulation, data aggregation methods*
- **Trend Charts**: Spending trends appear as line charts over time.
  - *Python concept: Inheritance, specialized plotting classes*

**Weeks 11-12: Testing & Production Quality**
- **Reliable Calculations**: Users experience fewer bugs and calculation errors.
  - *Python concept: Unit testing (unittest/pytest), assertions*
- **Edge Case Handling**: Unusual situations are handled gracefully.
  - *Python concept: Boundary testing, defensive programming*
- **Consistent Results**: The same inputs always produce the same results.
  - *Python concept: Test fixtures, repeatable test conditions*

## Phase 6: Advanced Capabilities (Weeks 13-14)
