- **Case: Context-Free vs. Context-Rich**
  - Ineffective: "How do I work with pandas DataFrames?"
  - Effective: "I'm analyzing weather data in a pandas DataFrame with temperature and humidity columns. I need to filter rows where temperature > 80°F and visualize the humidity distribution for those hot days."

### Intermediate Case Studies (Weeks 5-8)
- **Case: The Assumed Knowledge Problem**

  - Effective: "I have these class hierarchies [code] and need to implement the visitor pattern. Here's what each class represents in my domain..."

- **Case: The Constraint Communication Gap**
  - Ineffective: "Make this code run faster"
  - Effective: "This function processes large text files and is too slow. It currently takes 5 seconds for a 1MB file. I need it to process at least 10MB/second. Memory usage should stay under 100MB."

### Advanced Case Studies (Weeks 9-16)
- **Case: The Architecture Description Challenge**
  - Ineffective: "Design a system for user authentication"
  - Effective: [Detailed prompt with user flow diagrams, security requirements, integration points, and existing components]
